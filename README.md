The aim of this Masterâ€™s Project was to implement Shell Sort algorithm on Multiple processor and execute it in parallel. 
The parallel shell sort uses MPI (Message Passing Interface) to communicate within processors and share resources. 
The project was run on UB-CCR High computing infrastructure to collect running time of algorithm on different sets of processor and present the optimal processor configuration.
